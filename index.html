                <h3 class="sectionHead"> Advertising </h3>
                <p> The campaign was created locally for California McDonald's franchisees by Los Angeles advertising
                    firm
                    Davis, Johnson, Mogul & Colombatto. Looking to increase the after-4 p.m. dinner business, the agency
                    was inspired by the song "Mack the Knife" by Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht, which was made famous in
                    the
                    United States by Bobby Darin in 1959 and listened to different versions of it before opting to
                    create an
                    original version with new lyrics. After deciding not to feature real people or celebrities, the
                    designers settled on an anthropomorphic crooner moon on a man's body with 1950s-style sunglasses;
                    the
                    song and style were designed to appeal to baby boomers and a revival of 1950s-style music in popular
                    culture. The character, who played a grand piano atop either a floating cloud or a giant Big Mac
                    (hence the name), was intended to garner a "cult-like" following, e.g. Max Headroom. </p>

                <p> Doug Jones performed Mac Tonight for over 27 commercials for three years. Years later in 2013, he
                    recalled "[T]hat's when my career took a turn that I was not expecting. I didn't know that was a
                    career
                    option". Mac Tonight's voice was provided by Roger Behr. Director Peter Coutroulis, who won a Clio
                    Award for a previous campaign for Borax, pitched several commercials which did not air, including an
                    E.T.-like one in which two astronomers watch Mac Tonight drive his Cadillac through the sky. </p>

                <p> In 1989, Bobby Darin's son Dodd Mitchell Darin claimed that the song infringed upon his father's
                    trademark without prior permission and filed a lawsuit as well as an injunction for the song to be
                    removed from both TV and radio ads. As a response to the lawsuit, McDonald's stopped airing the
                    commercials and retired Mac Tonight after nearly four years of usage (though the character would
                    make a
                    brief return in McDonald's ads between 1996 and 1997). </p>

                <h3 class="sectionHead"> Return </h3>
                <p> In 2007, Mac Tonight was given a CGI makeover and starred in a new commercial in Singapore,
                    Malaysia,
                    Indonesia and The Philippines. He is no longer seen flying over the earth or a city with a piano,
                    but
                    instead he dances on top of a McDonald's store singing and playing a saxophone. </p>

                The lyrics of the advertising jingle are:

                <span> "All day and all night, step out for a bite. Oh for treats that delight, --24 Hours a day! Come
                    down
                    to Mac Tonight, hey! [Plays a Short Piece on a Saxophone] Chill out, (name of country), McDonald's
                    is 24
                    Hours Come down to Mac Tonight, -24 Hours 'round the clock. Come on down to Mac Tonight!" </span>

                <p> Recently, Taiwan has begun to run Mac Tonight advertisements with Mac speaking Mandarin Chinese.
                    Similarly, Hong Kong has a new commercial featuring the character, in which Mac Tonight is voiced by
                    singer Eason Chan, in order to promote local branches' new 24-hour operation schedule. </p>

                <h3 class="sectionHead"> Controversy </h3>
                <p> Mac Tonight is used as the basis for YTMND Internet meme character Moon Man, a white supremacist
                    rapper
                    voiced by AT&T's "Mike" text to speech program, with most of his songs being remixes of existing
                    songs,
                    with an extreme racist overtone. It soon garnered controversy shortly after its first remix in 2007.
                    Due
                    to
                    AT&T's text to speech program provided Moon Man's voice, it was soon edited to block any racially
                    derogatory epithets or swear words in an attempt to cull the number of remixes. McDonald's began
                    removing existing
                    Mac Tonight sculptures and animatronics from some of its restaurants in response to the widespread
                    remixes,
                    and YouTube began striking down many Moon Man-related videos from 2007 to the present automatically.
                    Several
                    videos were also DMCA-claimed and taken down by McDonald's from 2007-2008. Multiple change.org
                    petitions
                    were filed demanding YouTube cease removing the videos, the most recent of which from May 2015
                    having
                    reaching over 1200 signatures. YouTube has since stopped taking Moon Man videos down unless they
                    have
                    been flagged by users. </p>
            </div>
            <div id="legacy">
                <h3 class="sectionHead"> Legacy </h3>
                <p> While Mac Tonight would pretty much disappear from U.S. advertising, he was well-remembered by
                    people
                    who
                    saw him on TV. He would also linger in restaurant decor for a whole new generation to discover. </p>
                <p> These things, combined with his presence on the internet in the form of his original ads, fan sites
                    and
                    communities, have kept Mac alive. </p>
                <p> Will McDonald's ever use him again? Are they nervous about the character's random association with
                    hate
                    speech? It's hard to know, but if fans keep pushing and believing, it can happen. Mac Tonight needs
                    to
                    be reclaimed and the only way to do that is to take him out of retirement and put him front and
                    center,
                    singing about what he loves most, eating at McDonald's at night. </p>

                <h3 class="sectionHead"> Cultural Impact </h3>
                <p> Between 1997 and 1998, McDonald's sponsored NASCAR Hall of Famer Bill Elliott with Mac Tonight
                    featured
                    on his car. In 2016, the Mac Tonight theme was McDonald's driver Jamie McMurray's Chip Ganassi
                    Racing No. 1 Chevrolet SS throwback scheme for Darlington Raceway's Southern 500. </p>
                <p> Mac Tonight has appeared on the cover of Saint Pepsi's album Late Night Delight (with Luxury
                    Elite), and The Simpsons episodes "Kiss Kiss, Bang Bangalore" as a cardboard cutout and in
                    "Burger Kings" via Homer's imagination. </p>

                <h3 class="sectionHead"> Vaporwave </h3>
                <p> Vaporwave is a microgenre of electronic music, visual art style, and Internet meme that emerged in
                    the
                    early 2010s. It is defined partly by its slowed-down, chopped and screwed samples of smooth jazz,
                    elevator, R&B, and lounge music from the 1980s and 1990s. The surrounding subculture is sometimes
                    associated with an ambiguous or satirical take on consumer capitalism and pop culture, and tends to
                    be
                    characterized by a nostalgic or surrealist engagement with the popular entertainment, technology and
                    advertising of previous decades. Visually, it incorporates early Internet imagery, late 1990s web
                    design, glitch art, anime, 3D-rendered objects, and cyberpunk tropes in its cover artwork and music
                    videos.</p>
                <p> Following the wider exposure of vaporwave in 2012, a wealth of subgenres and offshoots emerged, such
                    as
                    future funk, mallsoft and hardvapour, although most have waned in popularity. The genre also
                    intersected with fashion trends such as streetwear and various political movements. Since the
                    mid-2010s,
                    vaporwave has been frequently described as a "dead" genre. The general public came to view vaporwave
                    as a facetious Internet meme, a notion that frustrated some producers who wished to be recognized as
                    serious artists. Many of the most influential artists and record labels associated with vaporwave
                    have
                    since drifted into other musical styles. Later in the 2010s, the genre spurred a revival of interest
                    in Japanese ambient music and city pop.</p>
